I've known that VoiceOver was a thing for a while, but I always had trouble figuring out how to start using it. This will be an introduction so that you can get the hang of using it for basic navigation.

## Opening Voiceover

To open VoiceOver, you can use the following: cmd + f5

## Basic Navigation

Most things in VoiceOver require you to use the VoiceOver (VO) key. By default, this is the caps lock key. You can tell it's working if, when you press it, instead of the green light staying on, it simply blinks. You can still use it by quickly pressing it twice.

Now that that's out of the way, to move around the page, hold down the VO button and navigate using the arrow keys. You should quickly be able to jump between areas of the page

## Interacting with Elements

Sometimes, elements like radio buttons are grouped together, and you will only be able to select them as a group. In order to interact with an element, use cmd + ctrl + Shift + down. This will take you into the element and you can navigate like normal. To stop interacting with the element, use cmd + ctrl + Shift + up.

## Selecting Elements

You can select an element like a radio button or a checkbox using the space key, but this won't give you any information. To get information about what you selected, do ctrl + cmd + space

## Take the Quick Start Tutorial

You can get some practice with this and more using the Quick Start Tutorial. To access this, turn on VoiceOver and press VO + h. This will open the help menu. Once there, navigate down to the QuickStart Tutorial using the arrow keys.
